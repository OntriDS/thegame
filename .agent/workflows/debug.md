# DEBUG COMMAND

**Purpose:** When facing complex bugs, create systematic testing tools instead of endless debugging attempts.

**What DEBUG does:**
1. **Analyze the Problem:** Identify bug type and testing needs
2. **Create Testing Tools:** Build self-check endpoints and repair tools
3. **Provide Clear Results:** Binary pass/fail results with detailed metrics
4. **Document the Solution:** Add debugging tools to /admin/log-tools page
