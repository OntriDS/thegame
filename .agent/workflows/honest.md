# HONEST COMMAND

**Purpose:** Force complete honesty and prevent lying, assumptions, and rushed implementations.

**What HONEST does:**
1. **Forces Actual Reading:** Must READ documents completely before responding
2. **Prevents Lying:** Cannot make up stories or claim things exist without verifying
3. **Enforces Proper Workflow:** Must follow command instructions completely
4. **Stops Rushed "Fixes":** Must understand existing patterns before making changes
5. **Accountability:** Must cite specific lines/evidence for claims

**Usage:** `HONEST` before any command (INTERNALIZE, ANALYSE, VERIFY) to enforce proper behavior.
