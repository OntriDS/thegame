**Philosophy**: "Genius is making the complex simple" - Simplify, don't overcomplicate.
**Dry Principle**: The project must follow strict dry principles, to avoid code duplication and misleadings.
**Unified Patterns**: All similar functionality must use the same pattern - no mixed approaches or incomplete implementations.
**Complete Implementation**: When we design a solution, we implement it fully across all entities - no partial migrations or "good enough" states.
**Smart Simplification**: Make the complex simple in the smartest possible way - not by avoiding complexity, but by solving it properly once.
**Worth Doing Right**: If something is worth doing, do it right from the first time - effort should equal great results, this avoids: effort x4 equals one good result.
