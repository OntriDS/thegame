# Patterns & Mechanics - TheGame Admin System

## Overview
This document defines the comprehensive patterns, workflows, and game mechanics for TheGame admin application. It covers the entities architecture pattern, game mechanics system, and implementation roadmap.

---

## **ENTITIES ARCHITECTURE PATTERN**

### **RESPONSIBILITIES PATTERN**

#### **Modal (UI Layer)**
**Purpose**: Pure UI form for data collection and validation.

**Responsibilities**:
- Collect and validate user inputs
- Emit entity (and optional sideEffects) via `onSave` callback
- Close immediately via parent-controlled open state
- Handle form state and user interactions

**What it DOES NOT do**:
- ‚ùå Call APIs directly
- ‚ùå Mutate global state
- ‚ùå Perform side effects or logging
- ‚ùå Handle persistence

**Example Pattern**:
```typescript
const handleSave = () => {
  const entity = buildEntityFromForm();
  const sideEffects = { isNew: !existingEntity };
  onSave(entity, sideEffects); // Emit to parent
  onOpenChange(false);   // Close modal
};
```

#### **Parent (UI State Manager)**
**Purpose**: Owns UI state, orchestrates data flow, updates UI.

**Responsibilities**:
- Own modal open/close state
- Receive entity from modal via `onSave`
- Close modal after receiving entity
- Call DataStore to persist entity
- Update local UI state from authoritative response
- Handle UI events and re-renders

**What it DOES NOT do**:
- ‚ùå Perform side effects or logging
- ‚ùå Handle business logic beyond UI state
- ‚ùå Call APIs directly (uses DataStore)

**Example Pattern**:
```typescript
const handleEntitySave = async (entity, sideEffects) => {
  setModalOpen(false);                    // Close modal
  const saved = await DataStore.upsertX(entity, sideEffects); // Persist via DataStore
  updateLocalState(saved);                // Update UI from response
};
```

#### **DataStore + Adapters (Client Gateway)**
**Purpose**: Unified client-side API that delegates to appropriate storage backend.

**Responsibilities**:
- Provide unified interface for all data operations
- Delegate to appropriate adapter based on environment
- Handle caching and UI event dispatching
- Manage cross-environment consistency

**Environment Detection**:
- **No KV detected** ‚Üí LocalAdapter (development)
- **KV available** ‚Üí HybridAdapter (production)

#### **LocalAdapter (Development/Offline)**
**Purpose**: Complete implementation for localhost development.

**Responsibilities**:
- Use localStorage for entity caching + filesystem for persistence
- **Mirror ALL server-side behavior**:
  - Trigger workflows (side effects)
  - Delegate logging to LoggingDataStore
  - Handle idempotency
  - Manage entity relationships
- Dispatch UI events for reactive components
- Provide complete parity with production

**Key Point**: LocalAdapter IS the "server-side" for localhost - it handles everything that production API routes handle.

#### **HybridAdapter (Production)**
**Purpose**: Production adapter with KV as source of truth.

**Responsibilities**:
- Fetch to API routes for persistence
- Manage browser cache (localStorage) for performance
- Dispatch UI events after successful operations
- Handle context-aware behavior (browser vs server)

**What it DOES NOT do**:
- ‚ùå Handle side effects (delegated to API routes)
- ‚ùå Write logs (delegated to API routes)

#### **API Routes (Production Only)**
**Purpose**: Server-side persistence and side effect orchestration.

**Responsibilities**:
- Persist entities to KV storage
- Trigger workflows for side effects
- Write logs via atomic operations
- Return authoritative entity to client

**Entity-Specific Links Effects**:
- **`/api/tasks`**: Inventory Item + Financial Log + Player Progress Log + Items Log + Tasks Log
- **`/api/financial-records`**: Inventory Item + Financial Log + Player Progress Log + Items Log
- **`/api/items`**: Inventory Item + Items Log

#### **Workflows + Logs (Both Environments)**
**Purpose**: Centralized side effect handling and logging.

**Responsibilities**:
- **Production**: Invoked by API routes
- **Development**: Invoked by LocalAdapter directly
- Atomic logging operations
- Idempotent side effect handling
- Cross-entity relationship management

## **GAME MECHANICS SYSTEM**

### **Role-Based Mechanics - The Foundation**

**CHARACTER** is the universal entity, **ROLES** define permissions:

```
CHARACTER < ROLES:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CUSTOMER ‚Üí sales, data, commcolor
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ FOUNDER ‚Üí god rights, extra features  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DESIGNER ‚Üí can complete design tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PRODUCER ‚Üí can do production tasks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SELLER ‚Üí can make Sales
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PLAYER ‚Üí can get points! progression and so on!
```

**KEY PRINCIPLE**: All game mechanics are **role-gated**:
- **Points, progression, tech trees** ‚Üí Only for characters with PLAYER role
- **Task completion** ‚Üí Based on role (DESIGNER can complete design tasks)
- **Sales creation** ‚Üí Based on role (SELLER can create sales)
- **Admin features** ‚Üí Only for characters with FOUNDER role

### **Entity Lifecycle Flow - The Core Process**

```
1. Entity Created/Updated/Deleted
   ‚Üì
2. Effects Registry processes the change
   ‚Üì
3. Cascade Engine checks what should happen to linked entities
   ‚Üì
4. Directional Workflow Engine checks if any workflows should trigger
   ‚Üì
5. Role-based gating: Actions executed only if character has required role
   ‚Üì
6. Actions are executed (create entities, update status, award points, etc.)
```

**This is the fundamental flow that every entity interaction follows in The Rosetta Stone system.**

### **File Structure and Relationships**

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game-mechanics/              # üéÆ THE CORE - All game mechanics in one place
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entity-rules.ts          # üß† THE BRAIN - Core rules and definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cascade-operations.ts    # ‚ö° CASCADE ENGINE - What happens on delete/update
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ directional-workflow.ts  # üöÄ WORKFLOW ENGINE - What happens on complete/create
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ adapters/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ link-local-adapter.ts    # üíæ LOCAL STORAGE - Development environment
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ link-hybrid-adapter.ts   # ‚òÅÔ∏è KV STORAGE - Production environment
```

### **Core Files Explained**

#### **1. `entity-rules.ts` - The Brain üß†**
**Location**: `lib/game-mechanics/entity-rules.ts`

**Purpose**: Defines the fundamental rules of the game mechanics system.

**Key Components**:
- **`LinkRule`**: Defines what happens when entities are deleted/updated
- **`DirectionalRule`**: Defines what happens when entities complete/create
- **`ENTITY_RULES`**: The complete rule set for all entity relationships

**Example Rule**:
```typescript
{
  linkType: 'TASK_ITEM',
  onSourceDelete: 'cascade',    // Delete Task ‚Üí Delete Item
  onTargetDelete: 'prompt',     // Delete Item ‚Üí Ask about Task
  onSourceUpdate: 'propagate',  // Task Done ‚Üí Update Item status
  onTargetUpdate: 'ignore'      // Item update ‚Üí Don't affect Task
}
```

#### **2. `cascade-operations.ts` - The Cascade Engine ‚ö°**
**Location**: `lib/game-mechanics/cascade-operations.ts`

**Purpose**: Handles what happens when entities are deleted or updated.

**Key Functions**:
- `evaluateDeleteCascade()`: Checks what should happen when deleting an entity
- `evaluateUpdateCascade()`: Checks what should happen when updating an entity
- `shouldBlockOperation()`: Determines if an operation should be blocked
- `requiresConfirmation()`: Determines if user confirmation is needed

**Example Flow**:
1. User tries to delete a Task
2. System finds all links involving that Task
3. For each link, checks the `LinkRule` for `onSourceDelete`
4. Returns actions: `cascade`, `prompt`, `block`, or `ignore`

#### **3. `directional-workflow.ts` - The Workflow Engine üöÄ**
**Location**: `lib/game-mechanics/directional-workflow.ts`

**Purpose**: Handles what happens when entities complete or are created (workflow automation).

**Key Functions**:
- `processWorkflowTrigger()`: Main function that processes workflow triggers
- `shouldTriggerRule()`: Checks if a directional rule should trigger
- `createWorkflowAction()`: Creates the appropriate action based on the rule

**Example Flow** (Feria Workflow):
1. Recurrent Task "Go to Feria" completes
2. System finds `TASK_SALE` directional rule
3. Rule triggers because `sourceStatus: 'Done'` and `metadata: { createsSale: true }`
4. System creates a new Sale entity with status 'PENDING'

### **The Rosetta Stone Effect**

#### **What It Achieves**

1. **Traceability**: Every entity action can be traced through its relationships
2. **Automation**: Workflows automatically trigger based on entity state changes
3. **Consistency**: Rules ensure consistent behavior across all entity interactions
4. **Coherence**: Isolated entities become part of a connected ecosystem

#### **Example: The Feria Workflow (Role-Gated)**

```
1. Recurrent Task "Go to Feria" completes
   ‚Üì (TASK_SALE directional rule)
2. Creates Sale entity (status: PENDING)
   ‚Üì (SALE_FINREC directional rule)
3. Creates Financial Record for the sale
   ‚Üì (TASK_CHARACTER, SALE_CHARACTER, FINREC_CHARACTER rules)
4. ROLE CHECK: Does character have PLAYER role?
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Awards Character points for all three entities
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO ‚Üí No points awarded (character might be CUSTOMER only)
```

#### **Example: The Artwork Workflow (Role-Gated)**

```
1. Task "Create Artwork" completes
   ‚Üì (TASK_ITEM directional rule)
2. Creates Item entity (type: ARTWORK, status: FOR_SALE)
   ‚Üì (ITEM_SALE link when sold)
3. Item gets sold in a Sale
   ‚Üì (SALE_FINREC directional rule)
4. Creates Financial Record for the sale
   ‚Üì (All entities check for CHARACTER links)
5. ROLE CHECK: For each linked character, does they have PLAYER role?
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ YES ‚Üí Character gets points for the entire workflow
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ NO ‚Üí No points awarded (character might be CUSTOMER only)
```

#### **Example: Character Creation Workflow**

```
1. Sale completed with customer "John Doe"
   ‚Üì (Sales workflow)
2. Character created: { name: "John Doe", roles: ["CUSTOMER"] }
   ‚Üì (No PLAYER role assigned)
3. Character can appear in sales data but cannot earn points
   ‚Üì (Future: FOUNDER can promote CUSTOMER to PLAYER role)
```

### **Consistency**
- All modals follow identical pattern
- All parents handle side effects the same way
- All APIs only handle persistence
- Side effects centralized in workflows

- No duplicate data or logs

### **Environment Parity**
- LocalAdapter mirrors production behavior
- Same side effects in both environments
- Same logging and idempotency
